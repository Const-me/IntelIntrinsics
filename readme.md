# Intel Intrinsics
This project builds a C# command-line app that parses Intel’s documentation into the developer-friendly CHM format.

You’ll find the compiled CHM file [on “Releases” page](https://github.com/Const-me/IntelIntrinsics/releases).

If the fonts are too small for you, [here’s a fix](https://superuser.com/a/204783/31483).
